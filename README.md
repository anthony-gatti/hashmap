## Project Description
This project is an exercise in implementing hashmaps in java using multiple styles of collision management. It implements one map with the buckets created using separate chaining, and a second using quadratic probing. It then inserts large amounts of data to track with solution is more efficient as the amount of input is increased.

### Program Execution
* The program is executed in linux using 'java Test'.
